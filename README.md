# SuperHeroArch

Project to learn about architecture and design patterns in Android.

We didn't find a proper super hero API, so we decided to go with Rick & Morty!

API docs: <https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation>

Guide: Follow [this guide](https://github.com/cmm-academy/SuperHeroArch/blob/main/Rick%20and%20Morty%20project.pptx) and ask your mentor your doubts!
